Reddit Scheduler App

-An ElectronJS packaged applet using Typescript, HTML and CSS to create a full reddit scheduling solution. 
Goals are to ultimately include in-built post checking, sub analytics and erroring if post requirements are
not met.

-Versions will follow 0.0 format, where the first digit indicates a whole version with substantial changes (i.e.
change in used tech, breaking changes and significant new features), these should be followed with a full Electron build & 
package. The second digit will be used for added in features and design changes. Versions will not be incremented until a full
1.0 build is achieved, to avoid constant changing throughout the early development stages.

Version 1.0: 

-First major changes incorporated, including switching to a much more heavily class-based system and establishing a basic
build task.
